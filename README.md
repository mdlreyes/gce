<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About

This is a simple galactic chemical evolution model designed for Local Group dSph galaxies.
It's based on the original code by [Kirby et al. (2011)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...727...79K/abstract) and later modified by I. Escala and G. Duggan.
This version of the code is designed to be much faster than previous versions; it does this by avoiding integration and instead forward-propagating an array of yields.
